            This sample demonstrates how to use the ConnectivityManager to determine if you have
            a network connection, and if so, what type of connection it is.
            \n\nA "NetworkInfo" object is retrieved from the ConnectivityManager, which contains information
            on the active connection, and then the connection type is printed to an on-screen console.
